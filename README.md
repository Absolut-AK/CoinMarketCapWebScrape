# WebScrapingProject
The problem I got from webscraping this website is that, first it's a reactive website, 
I couldn't load all of the page an causes errors, 
but that's not the only problem,
i couldn't determine if it's red or green because it didn't use font color to change the color of the percentage(increase or decrease),
I also tried to get each coin page and scrape the information there but the coins can have different names from webpage compare to crypto currency name
example https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/ I can change "multi-collateral-dai" with the currency that I scrape from the main page,
but the main page's name is "dai dai", but bitcoin is bitcoin, name of mainpage and inside the link.
